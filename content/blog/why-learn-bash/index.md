* working with text files and scripting your computer
    * The command line (CLI) is just faster and easier. I am forced to use a mac at work. Not hating on Macs, I just prefer Linux. I think the finder is just overkill unless I'm working with images. most of the time, I'm working with text and source code. I can write aliases for often used directories, write scripts that automate task/workflows that I use every day with crazy fast speed.
* tweaking existing scripts that are useful
   * There's about a trillion existing useful scripts that other (much smarter) engineers have written and if I know a little bash scripting, I can tweak it for my use.
* available everywhere
   * if you jump on a colleagues' machine, you probably will not have any idea how their particular setup works. But you can easily jusmp on the terminal and navigate code and directories like the pro you are.
* you can pair program with git on the command line regardless of the interface/IDE/etc...
    git stuff
* latency
* cloud services
   * you never know what sort of work you might have to do. Or if you need to ssh into a remote machine that doesn't have your beloved editor or tools. 99.9% will have a working terminal you can use to get shit done.
